git config --global user.name "Brian Crafton"
git config --global user.email "craftonbrian@gmail.com"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/craftonb/first-rails.git
git push -u origin master



origin is interchangeabele with anything
can also have multiple tags for that and they are all usable for whatever reason

i guess it just adds a remote origin ... and u can as many 'origins' as u want u just name them  different things and can push them all the same

git remote add a https://github.com/craftonb/first-rails.git
git push -u a master

can do this also and still works even after commit with origin
